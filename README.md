# Project from University: Bean Leaf Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project aims to classify bean leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras is trained to distinguish between healthy leaves and those affected by common diseases such as Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is processed and augmented to improve model generalization. The workflow includes data preprocessing, visualization, train-validation-test splitting, data augmentation, and CNN model training and evaluation.

This notebook demonstrates the application of computer vision and neural networks to agricultural disease detection, providing a foundation for real-world crop health monitoring solutions.
